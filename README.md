To reproduce my result, it's easier to follow the inference.ipynb notebook and execute the cells one by one in order. Or just follow the instructions below.

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qiNNz4Px3KYJclDy0IZNu_y-HrQERQ8W/view?usp=sharing) is the link to my final model.

First, you should clone the [repo](https://github.com/krasserm/super-resolution) and download the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12ncwDh5g9YKG3zKzvJ5X2MMo66tPlFbm/view?usp=sharing) for testing. (Keep the dataset folder under the repo directory)

Second, download the [model link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qiNNz4Px3KYJclDy0IZNu_y-HrQERQ8W/view?usp=sharing) to the repo directory.

Third, create a folder called `ans` and run inference.py with `python3 inference.py`

Finally, you should have the result images in the `ans` folder.
